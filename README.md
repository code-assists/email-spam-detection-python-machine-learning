## 📖 Abstract  
Email spam is one of the biggest challenges in cybersecurity and online communication.  
This project leverages **Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing (NLP)** to detect whether an email is **Spam or Not Spam**.  

The system integrates a **Python Machine Learning Model** into a **Django Web Application** with **MySQL database**, providing a **full-stack solution** for text preprocessing, feature extraction, and classification.  

The system uses:  
- **Text Preprocessing** (stopword removal, tokenization, lemmatization)  
- **TF-IDF Vectorizer** for feature extraction  
- **Naive Bayes Classifier** for classification  
- **Detection History Module** for tracking previous predictions

- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap  
- **Backend**: Python Django 5  
- **Database**: MySQL  
- **Machine Learning**: Scikit-learn, Naive Bayes, TF-IDF, Pandas, NumPy  
- **Development**: Jupyter Notebook + Django Web Application

It includes:  
- **Email/SMS Text** (input features)  
- **Label**:  
  - **Spam (1)** → Unwanted/Phishing email  
  - **Ham (0)** → Legitimate email  

The system applies:  
- Text cleaning & preprocessing  
- TF-IDF vectorization  
- Model training & evaluation with Naive Bayes
